# E2E Development Pipeline Exploration

This document outlines the exploration of an end-to-end (E2E) development pipeline for a specific application or project. The pipeline involves several stages, including data preprocessing, model development, testing, and deployment, which are all automated and monitored to ensure smooth integration and continuous improvement.

## Overview
The goal of this E2E pipeline is to create a robust framework for quickly iterating over model and software development, enabling faster deployments and reducing manual intervention. The following sections describe the various stages and technologies used in this pipeline.


## Conclusion
This exploration provides a broad view of the stages involved in an E2E development pipeline, highlighting key tools and practices that help automate and streamline development, testing, and deployment processes. Implementing a robust pipeline ensures better product quality, faster deployment cycles, and greater collaboration across development teams.
